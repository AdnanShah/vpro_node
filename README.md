# VPRO 2.0 API 
 API databse for a VPRO application, that I'm currentlly building, in my free time, for a company that i currentlly work as a Machine Operator.
 The ideas is based on a original app, that we are currentlly using. But since the application is old, and it started to lagg, and also sometimes crashing for no reason. I've decided to create a new version, for the company. 
 
 The API can late on be used for similar project, you create on you're own.  
 
 - The Application is still in development. I will update it regulary. 

# Packages 
  - Node.js 
  - TypeORM
  - Express.js
  - Multer 
  - MySQL

# How to start the application
  - First you need to install all the necesarry packages with the command ```npm install```
  - Then all you have to do is type ```npm start```

# Database
  - To set you're database all u have to do is add a username and password, and table name. 
  - After u run ```npm start``` the migrations will be added automaticlly.
